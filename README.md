# 📊 Currency Converter using python


**🚀Project Overview**

The Currency Converter project is a lightweight, user-friendly application designed to perform quick and accurate currency conversions using up-to-date exchange rates. Built primarily with Python, this project demonstrates key programming concepts such as API integration, data handling, user input validation, and error management.

By leveraging external currency exchange APIs, the converter fetches real-time exchange rates, allowing users to convert amounts between various world currencies with precision. The program focuses on simplicity and usability, providing clear prompts and formatted output, making it accessible for users with minimal technical knowledge.

This project is ideal for beginners learning how to work with APIs and external data sources, handle user input, and structure modular Python programs. It also serves as a practical tool for anyone needing quick currency conversions, such as travelers, students, or small businesses.




**🗃️ Features**
1. Convert any amount from one currency to another

2. Supports multiple global currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, INR, GBP, JPY, etc.)

3. Fetches live exchange rates from an API (or uses predefined rates if offline)

4. Easy-to-use command line interface (CLI)

5. Error handling for invalid currency codes or input amount


# 📂 How It Works

The currency converter takes an input amount and two currency codes: the source currency and the target currency. It then uses the current exchange rate to calculate and display the equivalent amount in the target currency.


**🛠️ Technologies Used**
📌 Python Stack
* Python – Core scripting for automation and analysis
