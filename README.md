# Currency Converter
A simple Python-based currency converter application that allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates.

# Features
1. Convert any amount from one currency to another

2. Supports multiple global currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, INR, GBP, JPY, etc.)

3. Fetches live exchange rates from an API (or uses predefined rates if offline)

4. Easy-to-use command line interface (CLI)

5. Error handling for invalid currency codes or input amounts

# How It Works
The currency converter takes an input amount and two currency codes: the source currency and the target currency. It then uses the current exchange rate to calculate and display the equivalent amount in the target currency.
